<h2>Installation and Setup</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python.org</a>.</li>
    <li>Clone or download this repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Install the required Python libraries, which are standard and should be available in your Python installation:
        <ul>
            <li><code>json</code>: For reading and writing user data to a JSON file.</li>
            <li><code>random</code>: For generating unique transaction IDs.</li>
            <li><code>system</code>: For access some variable and functions used or maintained by the interpreter</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Run the <code>ATM_Machine.py</code> script:
        <pre><code>python ATM_Machine.py</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to use the ATM system.</li>
    <li>You can perform actions such as checking your balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, or creating new user accounts.</li>
    <li>User data is stored in a <code>user_data.json</code> file and is loaded at the start of the program. Existing users are displayed, and you can perform transactions for these users.</li>
</ol>

<h2>User Data</h2>

<p>User data is stored in a JSON file named <code>user_data.json</code>. Each user entry consists of a User ID, a PIN, and an account balance. This file is automatically created if it doesn't exist.</p>
